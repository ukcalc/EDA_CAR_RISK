# EDA_CAR_RISK

This analysis is done in the purview of an Insurance Company insuring vehicles based on certain parameters.
It basically consists of three types of entities: 
  The specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics. 
  Its assigned insurance risk rating.
  Its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars. 

Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is riskier, this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuarians call this process "symboling". 

A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.

The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year.
